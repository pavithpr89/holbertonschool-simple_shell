.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 "December 2025" "Version 1.0" "User Commands"

.SH NAME
simple_shell \- The "Holberton special" Simple shell project that is meant to tax our brains

.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is a simple Unix shell that supports executing commands entered interactively or from a file.
It handles built-in commands and external programs found in the PATH environment variable.

.TP
.B Built-in commands
The shell currently supports the following built-ins:

.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell with the exit status of the last executed command.

.TP
.B env
Print all current environment variables.

.TP
.B External commands
Any program available in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable
can be executed by typing its name and arguments. The shell resolves the
full path internally before executing it.

.SH FEATURES
.TP
.B Interactive prompt
Displays ($) when input is from the terminal.

.TP
.B Command execution
Resolves commands using the PATH environment variable and executes them in a child process.

.TP
.B Error handling
Prints a message if a command is not found or cannot be executed.

.SH IMPLEMENTATION
The shell works internally as follows:

.TP
.B Input handling
Reads a line from standard input using getline().

.TP
.B Tokenization
Splits the input line into the command and arguments using strtok().

.TP
.B Command resolution
Internal functions search the PATH to find the full path of commands.

.TP
.B Process management
Forks a child process to execute the command, waits for it to finish, and retrieves its exit status.

.TP
.B Memory management
Allocates and frees memory for input lines and path resolution to prevent leaks.
